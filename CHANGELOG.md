## 0.7.0

This version introduces the signal activity. The signal activity stops the execution of the workflow machine and waits for a signal.

## 0.6.0

This version introduces the [parallel activity](https://nocode-js.com/docs/sequential-workflow-machine/activities/parallel-activity). The parallel activity allows to execute in the same time many activities.

**Breaking Changes**

* The `getStatePath` method in the `WorkflowMachineSnapshot` class is deleted. Please use the `tryGetStatePath` method or the `getStatePaths` method instead.

## 0.5.2

This version adds a possibility to stop a workflow machine. To stop a workflow machine, you should call the `tryStop()` method of the `WorkflowMachineInterpreter` class.

## 0.5.1

This version adds a new feature to the `fork` activity. Now it's possible to skip all branches. The handler of the `fork` activity should return a value returned by the `skip()` function.

```js
createForkActivity<BranchedStep, TestGlobalState>('if', {
  init: () => ({ /* ... */ }),
  handler: async (step, globalState, activityState) => {
    // ...
    return skip();
  }
})
```

## 0.5.0

This version simplifies error handling:

* The `getSnapshot()` method now returns an instance of the `WorkflowMachineSnapshot` class, which includes three new methods: `isFinished()`, `isFailed()`, and `isInterrupted()`. Additionally, you can retrieve the id of the last executing step by calling the `tryGetCurrentStepId()` method.
* The `unhandledError` property of the snapshot class is always an instance of the `MachineUnhandledError` class.

## 0.4.0

Updated the `sequential-workflow-model` dependency to the version `0.2.0`.

## 0.3.2

The `LoopActivityEventHandler` can return `void` or `Promise` now.

## 0.3.1

This version adds a new feature to the `break` activity. Now it is possible to break a parent loop without specifying the name of the loop. The previous approach is still supported.

```ts
createBreakActivity<BreakStep>('break', {
  loopName: (step) => -1,
  // ...
});
```

## 0.3.0

This version changes the syntax of all `create*Activity` functions. The first argument is the step type, the second argument is the configuration.

```ts
// Old syntax
const fooActivity = createAtomActivity<FooStep, MyGlobalState, FooStateState>({
  stepType: 'foo',
  init: /* ... */,
  handler: /* ... */
});

// New syntax
const fooActivity = createAtomActivity<FooStep, MyGlobalState, FooStateState>('foo', {
  init: /* ... */,
  handler: /* ... */
});
```

Additionally this version introduces the `createAtomActivityFromHandler` function. It allows to create an activity by very short syntax. This function creates an activity without the activity state.

```ts
const fooActivity = createAtomActivityFromHandler<FooStep, MyGlobalState>('foo', async (step, globalState) => {
  // handler
});
```

## 0.2.0

**Breaking Changes**

The activity state initializer has one new argument. The order of arguments is not backward compatible. The first argument is a step, the second argument is a global state.

## 0.1.3

Added two new activities: `LoopActivity` and `BreakActivity`.

## 0.1.2

Changed bundle format of the `sequential-workflow-machine` package to: UMD, ESM and CommonJS.

## 0.1.1

First release! ðŸŽ‰
